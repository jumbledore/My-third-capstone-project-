#### Description of dataset

A fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3.

#### What you learned

I have learnt how to use Powerbi to help present data. Powerbi is a powerful tool compared to excel as i am able to clean data in a more hassle free way and also the ability to drill through allows more flexibility and better efficiency in allowing my stakeholders to obtain the data required.

#### Edits made to raw data set

Included new column to present whether or not a customer is subscribed to a particular service as 1 (Yes) and 0 (No). 

#### Observations drawn from data
- Customers with dependents are more likely to subscribe to a 2 year data plan.
- Majority of customers are on a monthly subscription basis.
- Majority of customers that churn in San Diego are due to better services/products from competitor; data strongly suggests there is a new competitior.
- Majority of customers that newly joined are from Los Angeles. Customers that chrun in Los Angles is proportionally equivalent to customers that churn in other cities; reason for joining might not be due to better services/products but might be a result of better marketing.
